# time-varying-network-localization
This repository implements distributed estimation in time-varying sensor networks with Gaussian and non-linear observation models.

TVGaussianfilter: Implements cooperative localization problem in 2-dimensional setting. Presents a Gaussian version of proposed algorithm.
particle_xy_relpos: Implements particle filtering at sensors estimating a target position using noisy relative displacements. Can be run to observe distributed stratified resampling method.
particlexy: Implements particle filtering at sensors estimating a target position using noisy non-linear distances. Can be run to observe distributed stratified resampling method on non-linear observation models.
